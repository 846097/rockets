    <p>Wednesday night, on one day of rest, the Boston Celtics take on the Cleveland Cavaliers in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals.

The Cavs are prohibitive favorites, not only in Game 1 in Boston, but for the series as a whole â€” despite the fact that the Celtics are the higher-seeded team.

Boston knows that it doesn't have a roster capable of stopping LeBron James from going to his seventh straight NBA Finals. The Celtics knew it going into the season and halfway through it as well.

But despite having everything you need (and more) to go out and acquire another star player to bolster their 2017 title chances, the Celtics stood pat through the trade deadline.</p>
